# File-Automation
Python script to automate renaming a batch of files (e.g., sequencing data files).
The script firstly sorts the most common file types (e.g. pdf, excel, word doc and common sequening file formats) and once sorted, renames each file in numerical order.

An Additional aspect of basic web scraping has been added if required prior to filtering of files.
